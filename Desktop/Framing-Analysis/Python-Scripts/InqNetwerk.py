ArticlesABSCBN="""A "more calm" President Rodrigo Duterte appealed to governors to help in the administration's campaign against illegal drugs, Philippine National Police Chief Director General Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa said.
"Mas kalmado at more on appeal, not more on threat na pakabaril ko kayo sa chief of police," Dela Rosa said of Duterte's hour-long meeting with the governors on Thursday.
Just like the President's meeting with mayors, Dela Rosa said Duterte also cracked some jokes with the governors.
Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara, national chairman of the League of Provinces of the Philippines, described the mood of the meeting as "friendly."
Bichara said Duterte did not mention any names of governors linked to illegal drugs and instead showed them a thick pile of papers, supposedly containing names of narco-politicians which will be handed over to the Department of the Interior and Local Government.
"He really stressed his alarm. This drug thing is very disturbing to him, 
especially with the magnitude and the numbers," Bichara said in a phone interview on ANC's "Top Story."
Duterte also discussed federalism and denied state-sponsored extra judicial killings, according to Bichara.
"The way I see it, he really wants to provide autonomous government especially to the Mindanao region," Bichara added.

In yet another speech about the evils of illegal drug use, President Rodrigo Duterte compared drug addicts to slaves.
"Ang kawawa nito, actually they are slaves. Mabuti pa ang slave, kasi kung mabili mo sa African market, magamit mo pa sa trabaho mo. Ito, 
they are slaves eternally to a chemical sponsored by a criminal, his pockets full of money at the expense of the Filipino," 
Duterte said during the oath-taking of officials of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
In the same speech, Duterte also reprimanded the local officials involved in the illegal drug trade,
once again showing a stack of paper with the names of the alleged narco-politicians.


ROME, Italy - The ceasefire between the government and National Democratic Front (NDF) may be in peril as the communist group protested delays in the release of political detainees and alleged military invasion of areas they occupy. 
The NDF believes the five-month old truce is "no longer tenable" because it is allegedly being violated by state forces who push communist rebels to withdraw from civilian communities, NDF chief negotiator Fidel Agcaoili said Thursday. 
"Iyung aming forces on the ground, nararamdaman na nila na hindi na tenable. Hindi na tenable yung continuation ng ceasefire kasi nga ino-occupy yung mga communities. Pinupupwersa na sila mag-withdraw," Agcaoili told ABS-CBN News just hours before NDF and state negotiators meet for the third round of peace talks in Rome. 
(Out forces on the ground feel the ceasefire is no longer tenable because the military keeps occupying our communities. They force communists to withdraw.)
The alleged military advances, he added, violate several agreements signed during peace negotiations from the time of President Corazon Aquino up to the present, including the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees and Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL). 
The government also violates the CARHRIHL with the continued imprisonment of almost 400 political detainees, said Agcaoili. 
He urged the Duterte administration to prioritize releasing 130 political prisoners affiliated with the leftist movement, who are mostly sick and elderly. 
The military and the NDF declared separate unilateral ceasefire in August, paving the way for the first round of talks in August. To guarantee a prolonged truce, the NDF agreed to sign a bilateral ceasefire deal while the government promised to recommend amnesty for political detainees. 
'NO VIOLATIONS' 
But government peace panel chair and Labor Sec. Silvestre Bello insisted that the Army did not violate its own unilateral ceasefire because "there was no definition of terms" in the first place. 
"Wala tayong pinag-usapan na (we did not talk about) what would be considered as a hostile act and what would be considered violation of the ceasefire agreement," he said. 
Bello said this is why the government wants a joint ceasefire with the NDF so that "there will be clear definition of terms and conditions including agreement on who will be the referees."
The government, he added, remains committed to freeing political prisoners but their cases should undergo proper judicial process. 
Before the resumption of peace negotiations in Oslo in August, four years after the collapse of the last attempt, Duterte allowed 22 rebel leaders to post bail, including senior guerrilla commanders Benito and Wilma Tiamzon. 
In November, he also freed four elderly and sick prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
Rebel leaders however immediately demanded the release of 130 more rebels, which Duterte rejected,saying he had made enough concessions and was willing to let peace talks collapse if necessary.


MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said he will soon meet with the widows of slain Special Action Force (SAF) troopers who were killed in the January 2015 Mamasapano massacre.
In a speech in Malacañang, Duterte revealed he would meet with the widows of the slain policemen. He insisted that the meeting should not be politicized.
“I’ll meet the widows,” he said. “I’m not trying to scare anybody. I’m not trying to go into politics again.”
The Mamasapano massacre dealt a serious blow to the credibility and popularity of Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, as the operation which led to the deaths of 44 elite policemen was carried out allegedly under the orders of a suspended police chief.
The suspended police chief was Alan Purisima, who is known for his closeness to Aquino.
The main target of the anti-terror raid, Zulkifli bin Hir alias Marwan, was killed, but at the expense of the 44 cops who clashed with private armed groups, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and even the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which at the time was at the height of peace negotiations with the government.
Duterte once toyed with the possibility of ordering a reopening of the investigation into the massacre. He particularly wanted to know what happened to the $5 million bounty that the United States offered for Marwan’s arrest.
In his speech, Duterte said he was no longer interested to know what happened to the reward. He said what was bugging him was why air assets from certain parts of Mindanao were not deployed at the time of the clashes.
“I don’t want to bring this up but there are still disturbing issues surrounding Mamasapano. I only have one question for all.
“I’m not trying to revive or revisit the issue, but what’s bugging me is… why was it there was a war the whole day at hindi pinapasok ang sa Awang, Davao City, General Santos. Bakit hindi tinawag ang air assets?” Duterte said.




MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday named another elected official in his so-called “narco-list.”
During a speech in front of high-ranking police official in Malacañang, Duterte read the name of Licerio Antiporada. He said Antiporada was included under the category “elected officials” in Region 2 (Cagayan Valley) in his narco-list.
“Barangay captain siguro ito. Bigtime pusher, member, Antiporada-Prado Drug Group,” Duterte said.
Duterte has repeatedly threatened barangay officials in the country for their alleged involvement in the illegal drug trade.
He told police officials that nearly 40 percent of barangay officials in the country have links to drugs. 
The president met with mayors from around the country last week. He also had a meeting with governors today.
In a speech last Saturday, Duterte recalled how he confronted the mayors over the country’s drug problem.
“Baka akala ninyo nagbobolahan tayo dito. I called the mayors in the Philippines, ni-lockdown ko. Kung sabihin ko sa inyo, ‘i-lockdown din dito. Sarahan mo ‘yan diyan mga sundalo…’ Para walang magtsismis,” Duterte said in his Saturday speech in Davao City.
“Sinabi ko talaga sa kanila, totoo iyon and I said, pardon my language because very may mga…’P**** i** ninyo!’”
He also said that he would ask governors to exercise their supervisory powers over local officials, even as he threatened to order an ambush or poisoning of officials linked to the drug trade.
“Sinabi ko talaga. And I’d be calling the governors sa next week. Sabihin ko talaga sa kanila. You tell your barangay captains, may supervisory powers kayo and ‘yung mga cities under you, ‘yung hindi pa charter cities, you tell the mayors, reiterate to them,” Duterte said.
“But I would like to tell you, hindi ko kaya lecturan lahat ng ano…Huwag ka gyud magkumpiyansa sa akin, p***** i**, papatayin talaga kita. Believe me. Hahanapan kita ng ambush, lasunin kita.”


 MANILA - The president may declare martial law outside the parameters set in the Constitution and even without approval from co-equal branches of government, under certain circumstances
when people's welfare is on the line, the country's chief legal counsel claimed.
Solicitor-general Jose Calida told reporters in Malacañang Thursday that President Rodrigo Duterte may declare martial law beyond reasons like invasion and rebellion, which are the only two provisions stated under the 1987 Constitution.
"That is what is placed in the text book, but you know, there are certain situations as I said and these are hypothetical situations, when there is really a clear and present danger to our country, and nobody will help the President do his job as the father of the nation, he will not allow his family so to speak—us, Filipinos—to suffer because of the inability or unwillingness of certain functionaries to do what is right for the country," he said.
To illustrate this "extra-constitutional" move which is consistent with the saying that the welfare of the people is the supreme law, Calida drew from the ouster of former President Ferdinand Marcos through street revolt.
"In fact, during the 1986 EDSA revolution, if you notice, there was no martial law declared but there was a change in government. It was an extra-constitutional movement that changed the government. Why? Because probably during that time, there was really a need to do so," he said.
"We cannot put the President in a box and tell him you can only do these things because the President cares for the country and if the country faces imminent danger and nobody is acting then, the welfare of the people is the supreme law," he added.
But constitutionalist and former Commission on Elections chairman Christian Monsod maintains that Filipinos are still the final arbiter on the possible declaration of martial law.
"The final arbiter are the sovereign people of the Philippines. And the sovereign people have spoken on their position with respect to declaration of martial law in the Constitution, section 18 of Article 7," he said in a phone interview on ANC.
Monsod also advised the public not the be "overreactive" whenever Duterte or Malacañang officials discuss martial law.
"Let’s look at the signs. Let’s look at what he (Duterte) wants to do with the constitution. I think we should not be overreactive to everything he and his minions say," he added.
Over the weekend, Duterte said that he will declare martial law if the drug problem in the country worsens into something “virulent," but in a speech in Nueva Ecija Wednesday, he said he agrees with the military that there is no compelling reason yet to declare martial law.</articleproper>
But in the same speech Wednesday, Duterte again lamented the limits set by the Constitution on the declaration of martial law.
Under the Constitution, congressional approval is needed if the imposition of martial law will exceed 60 days. Any citizen may also challenge the basis of the declaration of the martial law before the Supreme Court.
Duterte reiterated, if this is the case, then the SC and Congress will most likely clash, since the legislative branch is usually allied with the executive.
“Who decides now? Ang Supreme Court sabi huwag. Sabi ng Congress yes. Who decides? The sitting president. So, ako,” he said.

President Rodrigo Duterte is a "political genius" who may sometimes be misinterpreted and who can not be "put in a box," Solicitor-General Jose Calida said Thursday.
Calida described Duterte as such after a reporter asked if Duterte's latest pronouncements regarding martial law may have been intended to bring out the loopholes in the 1987 Constitution to the public's knowledge and urge that these be amended. He admitted, this is "a possibility."
"Actually, as I said earlier, the president is a political genius. Sometimes, his statements are so deep that you may misinterpret what he’s really saying," he said.
"But you know, somebody said the mouth is a weapon of mass destruction, so probably he’s just messaging it so that people will get the idea and agree with him," he said.
Calida then highlighted that the maverick leader had been criticized "as being not a polished diplomat," but he was able to raise P1 trillion in official development assistance (ODA).
"Do you know of any previous presidents who did that? By mouthing those who criticized our president and insulted him and the sovereignty of the Filipino people?," he said.
"He’s a maverick and you cannot put him in a box, but we should just the result of what he is saying," he added.


UNFORGIVABLE: President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday revealed that he cursed a former police official he earlier tagged in the illegal drug trade.
During a speech before high-ranking police officials in Malacañang, Duterte said he cursed former Chief Superintendent and now Daanbantayan, Cebu Mayor Vicente Loot during his meeting with mayors at the presidential palace last week.
“Makita ko si Loot. Hindi ako nakapagpigil, minura ko. Sabi ko, ‘Mayor you are guilty of treason. You were once a police officer, inasahan ka ng gobyerno, ginastusan ka ng gobyerno tapos ganoon ang ginawa mo sa bayan?’” Duterte said.
“Unforgivable yung ganon. I cannot reconcile how you can be so corrupt na pati ang kalaban mo ang mismong tao.”
Loot is one of the five police officers identified by Duterte as allegedly involved in illegal drug trade.
Loot was director of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Training Service and director of Police Regional Office 8 before retiring.
He won as mayor of Daanbantayan, Cebu in the recently concluded May 9 elections.
Loot has denied the accusation against him, claiming he is a victim of "black propaganda."

PLOT THICKENS: A former cop turned barangay chairman is being eyed as a person of interest in the kidnap-slay of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo after the latter's ashes were found in the funeral parlor owned by the village chief.
The National Bureau of Investigation is now considering a barangay chairman in Caloocan City as a person of interest in the kidnap-slay of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo, 
Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan said Barangay 165 chairman Gerardo Santiago, who owns the funeral parlor where Jee’s remains were reportedly kept, filed a leave of absence from January 10 to February 10.
The Department of Justice, citing Immigration records, has confirmed that Santiago flew to Vancouver, Canada on January 11 on board Philippine Airlines flight PR-118. 
Santiago left the country on the same day that Jee's wife sought help from Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa about the abduction of her husband. 
According to Malapitan, Santiago retired in 2007 from the Northern Police District, where he had worked with SPO3 Ricky Sta. Isabel. 
Sta. Isabel and several other policemen have been accused of using President Duterte's war on drugs as a cover for the kidnapping of Jee from his home in Angeles, Pampanga last October 18. 
A Seoul-based news agency, citing police sources, said the victim appeared to have been strangled to death on the same day of his abduction. 
NBI agents found Jee's ashes at the Gream Funeral Homes owned by Santiago. 
The kidnappers' leader, reportedly a retired police general, allegedly ordered the cremation.
Santiago will be charged with dereliction of duty if he does not return to their barangay when his leave of absence ends, said Malapitan. 
Sta. Isabel, for his part, has sought protective custody from the NBI and denied the accusations. 
The PNP, meanwhile, said it has already placed the other policemen linked to Jee's abduction under restrictive custody. 
Senator Panfilo Lacson is seeking a legislative inquiry into Jee's death. 
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se has also discussed the case with his Philippine counterpart, Perfecto Yasay, who reportedly vowed a thorough investigation and punishment for those involved. 
Ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck, quoting Yun, said the case "poses concerns to the safety of South Koreans" in the Philippines. He said more than 1 million South Koreans visit the Philippines every year.


MANILA – The Philippines has sold $2 billion in dollar-denominated bonds despite volatility in the global market, highlighting investor confidence in the economy and the new government of President Rodrigo Duterte, the country’s treasurer said Thursday.
The 25-year securities, which were priced at par to yield 3.7 percent, were oversubscribed, National Treasurer Roberto Tan told ANC’s “Market Edge with Cathy Yang.”
Manila will “look into” a possible yuan bond issue next year, Tan said, adding the foreign component of this year’s borrowing program was finished.
“This is an achievement that we can be proud of, particularly now that we are under new leadership, showing the confidence of the international investor market on the economy as well as the new administration,” Tan said.
“For emerging markets, the Philippines stands out as one of the favorites,” he said.
It was Philippines' the first foreign debt issue under Duterte, who assumed office in June last year with the promise to fight crime and corruption.
The economy grew 7.1 percent in the third quarter last year, Duterte’s first three months in office. The pace maintained the Philippines’ status as one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.
Asked about yuan-denominated debt or “panda bonds,” Tan said: “We will probably look inot that but it might be sometime after this year. We have not programmed a panda bond issuance this year.”
