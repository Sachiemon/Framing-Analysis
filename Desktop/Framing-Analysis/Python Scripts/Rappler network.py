ArticlesRappler="""A year after his controversial profanity-filled public remarks, President Duterte has sent a letter to Pope Francis to assure his deep respect for the pontiff and affirms the country’s “special relations” with the Vatican.
The President has asked Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza to deliver his personal letter to the pontiff in Rome at the sidelines of the 3rd round of peace talks between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDF.
“With profound respect, I have the honor to extend my own and my people’s warmest greetings to Your Holiness,” the President’s letter read.
“Our countrymen remember Your Holiness’ apostolic visit in 2015 with deep appreciation, knowing that it was made with the most sincere regard for the welfare of the Church’s flock. The Philippines values its special relations with the Holy See and regards with gratitude your Holiness’ gracious stewardship of the Catholic faith,” the letter read.
The letter ended with the President’s words: “Please accept, Your Holiness, the assurance of my highest esteem and respect.”
Early in the day, Dureza said he would hand over the President’s “thank you” letter to the Vatican.
“Tomorrow, we will be at Vatican in the morning to hopefully meet the Pope in the ‘bacciamano’  kissing of the hand , (done only on Weds) and possibly hand to His Holiness a personal letter of President Duterte thanking Him for the Phil papal visit last year,” Dureza said in a Facebook post.
Dureza, a close ally of the President, traveled to Rome mainly to attend another round of peace negotiations between the government and the local communist group.
Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella confirmed the President has written a letter to the Pope but declined to divulge its content. “The letter is not open to others. It was simply directed to the Pope,” Abella said in a Palace press conference.
In November 2015, then presidential aspirant Duterte drew a firestorm of criticism after cursing the Pope for causing traffic gridlock during his five-day apostolic visit to the country in January 2015.
Duterte has already apologized to the Pope through a letter and the Vatican responded with an offer of prayers. “The Holy Father offers the assurance of his prayers for you, as he invokes upon you the divine blessings of wisdom and peace,” the Vatican letter dated February 24, 2016 read.
SPREADING MERCY
Meanwhile, Pope Francis has asked the delegates attending the Fourth World Apostolic Congress on Mercy (WACOM)  here to find new ways to express God’s mercy.
The message of the pontiff was relayed by Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the Archbishop of  Lyon, France, who presided over a Mass at the University of Santo Tomas Tuesday, the second day of the congress.
“He asks you to carry on seeking and finding new ways to express God’s mercy,” said the cardinal.
Barbarin said the Holy Father is also asking the faithful to look for “appropriate answers to the social problems of our time.”
Meanwhile, in his homily, Lingayen Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas challenged those present to be merciful.
“Dare to be merciful. Do not be afraid to be merciful,” he said.
The problem with some people, Villegas said is that they are afraid to show mercy.
“We need mercy yet we are afraid to show mercy. Instead of mercy there is terror, instead of mercy there is anger, instead of mercy there is revenge,” said Villegas.
“In order to protect ourselves we withhold mercy, in order to protect ourselves we refuse to give mercy because nobody ever dared to call me foolish. But isn’t that how Christians are called fools for Christ? If we are not ready to be called fools for the merciful Christ then we might be called, we might be worshipping another God not the God of mercy,” he added.
He cited different signs that show that we are people afraid of mercy. Among them are the fear of scarcity, the fear of being opposed, the fear of silence, the fear of waiting.
“Do not be afraid to have nothing. Do not be afraid to be empty brothers and sisters, I dare you. Dare to be merciful. Do not be afraid to be merciful and it is the power of our mercy patterned after the mercy of the Almighty that the world will see that the peace, freshness, new life that we have been looking for all these years,” said Villegas.
WACOM is an international gathering of Divine Mercy devotees and promoters, such as bishops, priests, religious brothers and sisters and the laity. It is convened every three years.
The five-day Church event, which began on Monday, will be held at the National Shrine of Padre Pio in Santo Tomas, Batangas on Wednesday, the National Shrine of the Divine Mercy in the Diocese of Malolos on Thursday, and the Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in the Diocese of Balanga on Friday.

Government may give up at least P139.6 billion to implement President Duterte’s campaign pledge to lower personal income tax rates but will gain at least P206.8 billion from the deal by imposing new or additional taxes on petroleum products, automobiles, and lottery winnings.
In House Bill 4774 containing the revised tax reform package proposed by the Department of Finance (DOF), stricter measures will be carried out to plug tax leaks in the implementation of the value-added tax provision of the National Internal Revenue Code.
The bill, filed last Tuesday by House Committee on Ways and Means chairman and Quirino Rep. Dakila Carlo Cua, also proposes to relax the Bank Secrecy Act for tax fraud investigations and cases.
Cua said the bill is expected to be passed by June, 2017 to help government raise the 2018 national budget.
It also provides expansion of the VAT base by limiting exemptions to raw food and other commodities.
Even before the chamber could tackle the bill, the House minority bloc quickly aired its opposition to the proposed hike in fuel taxes.
Minority Leader Danilo Suarez vowed to thoroughly scrutinize the measure that government claimed to be an anti-poverty proposal.
On the other hand, Akbayan Rep. Harry Roque filed a bill that proposes to prohibit the imposition of additional taxes unless a set threshold absorptive capacity benchmark and tax collection target are met by the concerned government agencies.
Under House Bill 4755, absorptive capacity benchmark refers to the percentage of unused appropriations of the annual national budget divided by the total amount of appropriations available for any given year.
HB 4774 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion is the second DOF-version of the proposed income tax reduction measure, the first one having been rejected for containing provisions that takes away from senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs) their VAT exemption privileges. It proposes adjustment of the personal income tax (PIT) brackets to correct for income bracket creeping, reduction of the maximum rate to 25 percent over time, except for the highest income earners to maintain progressivity, and shift to a modified gross system to simplify the PIT system.
Expected losses in revenue collections may reach P139.6 billion.
For government to recover the unrealized revenues, the bill provided for the implementation of new and additional taxes on petroleum, car sales, and lotto winnings.
Once fully implemented in 2018, government stands to get a windfall additional revenue of at least P67 billion.
Finance Undersecretary Karl Chua revealed that the total projected government revenue in the first year of implementation alone will total P206.8 billion.
Under the bill, individual taxpayers earning not over a P250,000 annually will be exempted from paying taxes.
HB 4774 provides that excise tax on petroleum products will increase annually as soon as it is signed into law by the president.
Included are: lubricating oils and greases, including but not limited to, base stock for lube oils and greases, high vacuum distillates, aromatic extracts, and other similar preparations, and additives for lubricating oils and greases, whether such additives are petroleum based or not, per liter and kilogram respectively, of volume capacity or weight, from P4.50 to P7 in 2017, P9 in 2018 and P10 in 2019.
Annual tax hike will also be imposed on processed gas, per liter of volume capacity, from P0.05 to P3 in 2017, P5 in 2018 and P6 in 2019; waxes and petrolatum, per kilogram, from P3.50 to P7 in 2017, P9 in 2018 and P10 in 2019.
Other fuel products to be subjected to annual excise tax adjustments are denatured alcohol; naptha, regular gasoline, premium and leaded gasoline, aviation turbo jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel oil, LPG or liquefied petroleum gas, asphalts, and bunker fuel oil.
The bill also said the tax rates shall be increased by 4 percent every year thereafter effective January 1, 2020 through revenue regulations issued by the secretary of the Department of Finance.
For automobiles, ad valorem tax will be levied on the manufacturer’s or importers selling price, net of excise and VAT.
Under the measure, if the net manufacturer’s price/importer’s selling price is P600,000 the excise tax will be 4 percent.
For cars sold at prices ranging from P600,000 to P1.1 million, excise tax will be 40 percent of the value in excess of P600,000.
High-end vehicles with selling price of P1.1 million to P2.1 million, the excise will be levied 100 percent of the value in excess of P1.1 million.
If the net manufacturer’s price/importer’s selling price is P2.1 million the excise will be 200 percent of the value in excess of P2.1 million
On the relaxation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the bill authorizes the BIR commissioner to inquire and receive information on bank deposit accounts and other related data held by financial institutions.
Also, under the bill, a final tax at the rate of 20 percent will be imposed on all lottery winnings, including those offered by Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office through its lottery games.
The bill added that the tax for each calendar year shall be 6 percent and shall be computed on the basis of the total net gifts made during the calendar year, provided that annual net gifts not exceeding P100,000 shall be exempted.
Meanwhile, Cua said to properly determine the correct taxes to be paid on the part of the taxpayer and the correct taxes to be collected on the part of the BIR, it has been mandated that all establishment shall issue electronic receipts or invoice, as the case maybe, which shall be directly generated and transmitted to the BIR upon sale.
The senior administration lawmaker said that on putting up a fuel marking and monitoring system, the intended results are increased revenue from fuel taxes and high quality petroleum sold in the market.
“This step will certainly plug the leakage of duties and taxes due on this commodity and protect both the consumers and the environment,” Cua stated.

President Duterte yesterday said he will not declare martial law unless he feels the need to preserve the country’s national security.
He stressed this after his threat to declare martial law over the weekend if the country’s situation becomes virulent.
“I will not declare martial law. If I will declare martial law hindi ako mag-iingay (I would not create a fuss about it),” he said during the 20th anniversary celebration of the Premiere Medical Center in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija.
The President also agreed with military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla that so far there is no compelling reason for him to declare martial law. However, he said that if he feels he needs to in order to preserve the country, then he will do so even if it is not bound in the present, existing Constitution.
Duterte also said that the Islamic State is quickly contaminating the country but he did not specify whether this would be his basis to declare martial law.
Hitting critics
Meanwhile, Duterte once again hit the critics of his drug war, particularly the Catholic Church and outgoing US President Barrack Obama, telling them to talk to him only if they are ready to come down to reality.
“Dapat ang ibang pari, cardinal, bishop, mag-shabu para maintindihan nila. Sa kanila walang shabu pero asawa meron (These priests, cardinals, and bishops should try illegal drugs so they would understand. They don’t have drugs but they have wives),” he said.
“Si Obama, with all the wisdom and pretensions of honoring the great principle of human life, even suggesting that I should be prosecuted in the international court, pero hindi naman sila member ng international court (but they are not even a member of the international court).”
“Talk to me when you are ready to go down to reality,” he said.
War is not over
The President also said that his war on drugs will probably not end even after six years.
“The killings, believe me, will not stop until the last pusher is out in the streets, even the drug lords,” he said.
“When I became president, I finally got access to all information. For three to five years, we were already a narco-politic country. To my horror, ganoon na karami (there were already so many) [narco politicians].”
Duterte had earlier threatened the mayors in his final drugs list to “resign or die.” Over the weekend, he confronted truckloads of mayors who came to the Palace.
Yesterday, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez revealed that there are two incumbent congressmen in the drug list.
Duterte to meet govs
Today, President Duterte will meet the country’s governors and may likely discuss the progress of the government’s war on illegal drugs, the same way he did when he met with mayors last week.
All five governors in the Western Visayas region will attend the meeting.
Anthony Nuyda, regional director of Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), confirmed to Manila Bulletin the attendance of Governors Florencio Miraflores of Aklan, Rhodora Cadiao of Antique, Tony Del Rosario of Capiz, Samuel Gumarin of Guimaras, and Arthur Defensor Sr. of Iloilo.
Duterte could be particularly interested in the anti-drug campaign in the city and the province of Iloilo which he said had been “shabulized,” the term he coined to describe the unabated trafficking of shabu in a particular area where police and local officials allegedly protect drug lords.
Last year, Duterte named four incumbent mayors, former officials, and police officers in Iloilo who are allegedly drug protectors.
Traders into drugs
Duterte has also claimed that some legitimate businessman are dealing with illegal drugs, destroying the lives of millions of Filipinos in the process.
“Mga droga, may kompetensya ang mga negosyanteng legit (Drugs, these legitimate businessmen are competing against each other). What? Drugs. Overnight to become a sensation.
“What is really raging in my heart is that you are making so many slaves, millions of them in my country. Honestly, hindi ko talaga matanggap ‘yan (I cannot accept that). They are slaves to a chemical and making the people very rich.”
Duterte also recalled his conversation with US president-elect Donald Trump. He said Trump congratulated him on his war on drugs and for “doing it right.”  (With a report from Tara Yap)

For the first time in history, the Philippines is ready to export corn to neighboring countries as corn harvests this year will breach 
the 5.6-million tons domestic requirement, according to Agriculture Secretary Manny Piñol.
National Corn Program coordinator, Asst. Secretary Federico Laciste reported that in spite of the series of natural calamities which hit the country recently, including the 7-month El Niño, yellow and white corn harvest for 2017 is expected to hit 8.1-million metric tons.
The production of Cassava, which is lumped with corn in the animal feeds category, is seen to reach 570,000 metric tons and this will contribute further in stabilizing the corn and animal feeds supply in the Philippines.
This is the first time that the Philippines will achieve a 120% corn sufficiency.


Pope Francis has offered to bestow his papal blessing on the Philippines and its leader President Rodrigo Duterte after receiving a letter from him.
Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza shared the Pope’s message during his visit to the Vatican on Wednesday.
“I said: ‘Bless the Philippines, Your Holiness.’ Pope Francis: ‘I will also bless your President,’” Dureza said after traditional “baciamano” or kissing the Pope’s ring, at the Vatican.
Dureza is in Rome to attend the third phase of the peace talks with the Government of the Philippines and the Communist Party of the Philippines/National Democratic Front.

An affordable loan program will be launched in this city next week being one of the three pilot areas in the abolition of the so-called “5-6” money lending scheme popularized by Indian nationals in the country.
The new program is tentatively scheduled for launching at the city public market here on Jan. 25. Arrangements are being made for President Rodrigo Duterte to lead the launching, said Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Regional Director Cynthia Nierras.
Pres. Duterte, who ordered for a crackdown of loan sharks last week, is set to visit post-Yolanda housing projects in the northern part of the city on Jan. 25.
The city government provided a space at the public market for the office of Small Business Corporation (SBC), the DTI’s financing arm.
The office will be manned by three staff, with two of them tasked to collect payment around the market on a daily basis.
“Tacloban is a pilot area for the Visayas because our market vendors are most in need of this kind of assistance due to reeling impacts of supertyphoon Yolanda,” Nierras said.
Other pilot areas are San Jose, Occidental Mindoro for Luzon and Alabel, Sarangani for Mindanao.
The 2017 General Appropriations Act has included an initial funding of P1 billion for financial assistance, a part of the planned P19 billion financing initiative for micro and small businesses in the next five years.
The program’s fund will be lent out in the business centers in selected provinces, where the participating microfinance institutions (MFIS) and the SBC can operate.
The government earlier identified 30 poorest provinces in the country as priority areas for the micro-financing program, which include Leyte, Samar, eastern Samar, and northern Samar.
Priority beneficiaries include microenterprises and entrepreneurs that do not have easy access to credit, or are accessing credit at very high cost, such as, micro-entrepreneurs, market vendors, agri-businessmen and members of cooperatives, industry associations and co-operators.
Loanable amount per end-borrower can range from PHP5,000 for start-ups to PHP300,000.00, with maximum interest rate of 26 percent every year with no collateral requirement.
This rate is significantly below the hefty 20 percent per day, week, or month charged by “5-6” lenders. It is also lower than what is charged by most MFIs in the country.
In a meeting with his Cabinet on Jan. 9, Pres. Duterte took up the “5-6” money lending scheme and ordered the arrest and deportation of foreigners involved in this practice, especially Punjabis from India.


The provincial government of South Cotabato is set to honor a tribal weaver from Polomolok town who was declared earlier this month by President Rodrigo R. Duterte as a National Living Treasure.
Board member Edgar Sambog, the province’s indigenous people’s mandatory representative, said on Thursday the local government will give the highest honor to Bai Yabing Masalon Dulo, who was conferred with the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan Award (GAMABA).
He said the recognition will be given to Bai Yabing during the celebration of the National Arts Month in February.
“Her achievement is a big honor to the tribal communities and entire constituents of South Cotabato,” he said.
Sambog said his office is working on the passage of a resolution that will give special recognition to Bai Yabing, the province’s second GAMABA awardee.
Bai Yabing, who was one of the three weavers honored with the prestigious award, hails from the B’laan tribe.
She was conferred with the award by virtue of Proclamation No. 126 signed by President Rodrigo Duterte.
The award mainly recognized her “commitment and contribution in safeguarding and promoting” the mabal tabih (ikat weaving) tradition.
Republic Act 7355 provided for the recognition of the country’s National Living Treasures or “Manlilikha ng Bayan” who are engaged in a highly technical and artistic level of traditional art.
“At the age of 106, Bai Yabing is still passing on her skills on ikat weaving to her children, grandchildren and students,” Sambog said.
The official said he is set to discuss with South Cotabato Gov. Daisy Avance-Fuentes the granting of additional incentives for Bai Yabing, who is also considered as a “dreamweaver.”
Such title became popular with the late Be Lang Dulay, a T’boli weaver who was declared a National Living Treasure in 1998 by President Fidel Ramos.
Lang Dulay, who died in April 2015, was known for her contributions in the preservation of the T’boli culture through the tribe’s famed T’nalak fabric.


OZAMIZ CITY – With the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte operating on a campaign against crime, corruption, and drugs, the Ozamiz City local government launched this week its Alsa Ozamiz program, which pushes civilian-barangay partnerships with government and non-government agencies to prevent “all that is illegal.”
Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog, in a press conference Wednesday, said the program rides on the memory of the Alsa Masa counterinsurgency in the 1980s to remind people to be involved in combatting illegal activities here.
Aside from curbing crime and drug proliferation, the local government here is also pushing for the eradication of other illegal activities such as illegal fishing, gambling, and logging, with members of  the barangay to be actively involved in providing information to authorities.
At the launch scheduled Wednesday afternoon, one representative from each family in the barangays in the city, will pledge that no one from their family will be involved in any illegal activity.
According to Parojinog, the Alsa Ozamiz program is 16 years in the making.
“Even before the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, we have been doing all we can to prevent illegal activities here,” she said. “Now, more than ever, with President Duterte, we want to show our dedication to the thrust of the administration.”
Even the operators of illegal gambling activities appear to be cooperative.
In front of the Ozamiz City Hall, the local government now has in its custody at least 265 video-karera machines surrendered by operators to barangay officials.
Mayor Reynaldo Parojinog, Sr. said that this was a significant change in the area, since the illegal computerized gambling activity was directly linked with drugs, with players known to be under the influence of illegal drugs.
Other gambling activities have also curbed, such as illegal logging, mahjong, and tong-its, the local government officials said.
Vice Mayor Parojinog said that the image of Ozamiz City to those outside the city has been tainted by years of ill reputation about the peace and order situation here.
“It has even affected the employment of job applicants coming here,” she said. “There has been discrimination.”


President Rodrigo Duterte will visit China in May to attend a multilateral summit, China’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, January 19, his second visit to China since taking office as he seeks to further distance himself from Washington.
Duterte has carried out a stunning U-turn in Philippines’ foreign policy since assuming office last year, making overtures towards China while berating traditional ally the United States.
In a statement issued after Duterte met China’s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin in Manila on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry said Duterte said he was pleased with how ties had developed since he came to China last year.
“I will come to Beijing in May to attend the ‘One Belt, One Road’ international cooperation summit forum, and I look forward to meeting President Xi Jinping again,” the ministry paraphrased Duterte as saying, without elaborating.
The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs said it could not immediately confirm the comments were made as no ministry officials were present at the meeting.
China has given few details about the summit, but diplomatic sources in Beijing say the government is expected to invite a large number of foreign leaders to attend.
China has dubbed a series of infrastructure projects stretching across some 60 countries as the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, based upon resurrecting the old Silk Road that once connected China with Central Asia, Europe and beyond.
Duterte reiterated last month he wanted to avoid confrontation with China and saw no need to press Beijing to abide by a July ruling on China’s claims in the disputed South China Sea that went in favor of the Philippines.


A comprehensive agreement that would end hostilities between the government and the leftist group could be reached “as early as 2020,” said Communist Party of the Philippines founding chairman and National Democratic Front of the Philippines senior political consultant Jose Maria Sison.
Speaking at the opening of the third round of talks between the NDFP and the Philippine government (GRP) on Thursday, January 19 in Rome, Italy, Sison expressed confidence that both sides will be able to sign agreements on socioeconomic affairs, and political and constitutional reforms that would “lay the full basis of the Comprehensive Agreement on the End of Hostilities and Disposition of Forces as early as 2020–2021.”
“The advantage of having the CASER (Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms and CAPCR (Comprehensive Agreement on Political and Constitutional Reforms) signed and approved by both principals within the first two years of the Duterte government is that these agreements shall be implemented for at least two years before the end of said government,” Sison noted.
He added that “the prospect is in sight that within six months, the CASER shall already be ready for signing.”
The CASER, said to be the backbone of the talks, tackles contentious issues related to genuine land reform, national industrialization and the expansion of social services.
On the signing of a CAPCR, Sison pointed out that the NDFP was “willing to maintain its alliance with the GRP and Duterte administration by cooperating in the founding of the Federal Republic of the Philippines, creating a parliamentary system and making a new constitution that upholds, defends and promotes national independence, democracy, economic development, social justice, cultural progress, independent foreign policy and international solidarity with peoples and all countries for peace and development.
“In various ways, President Duterte can prove in real and concrete terms that he is truly a patriotic and progressive president, and fights against the imperialists and oligarchs for the benefit of the people.”
But while Sison’s statement was welcomed in this third round of talks—which started in August—aimed at ending the 47-year armed conflict between the government and the insurgents, he barely mentioned anything about the possibility of reaching an agreement on a joint ceasefire.
The GRP panel has reportedly been given specific marching orders by President Duterte to forge a deal for a more permanent, bilateral ceasefire as a precondition for the release of more political prisoners, which began last August with his order to free 22 NDFP consultants.
Earlier reports said Duterte would be willing to immediately order the release of some of the prisoners once he sees a copy of a formal agreement on the implementation of a joint ceasefire, which had eluded both sides in the decades of negotiations under five previous presidents.
The NDFP is asking for the release of nearly 400 detained comrades who are sick, women and elderly.
Sison only said he was satisfied with the exchange of drafts by the two sides on the joint monitoring committee, which will be tasked with overseeing the implementation of the bilateral ceasefire.
“I am one with President (Rodrigo) Duterte’s optimism that in this round of talks, we are able to finalize and approve the joint ceasefire agreement,” said government panel chairman Silvestre Bello III. “Towards this agenda, the GRP panel has come prepared to exchange and discuss our drafts on said agreements.”
Part of its preparation for the third round focused on the immediate release of imprisoned communist insurgents once a bilateral ceasefire accord is signed.
ALL HANDS ON DECK—Leaders of the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines put their hands together at the start of the third round of peace negotiations in Rome, Italy. With them is Ambassador Eric Forner of Norway, official third party negotiator of the negotiations. In photo are (from left) NDFP chief political consultant Jose Maria Sison, NDFP peace panel chairman Fidel Agcaoili, GRP peace panel chairman Silvestre Bello III, foreign affairs secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. and presidential adviser on the peace process Jess Dureza.
But the NDFP has raised new issues that could derail the plan.
“We clearly state today that the release of the political prisoners should not be seen as a mere confidence-building measure or a gift to the NDF. It is an obligation of the GRP under CARHRHIL (Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Laws),” said NDFP peace panel chairman Fidel Agcaoili.
Agcaoili argued that the political prisoners “should not be treated as trump cards to extract concessions from the NDFP,” saying that “such conduct is bound to further erode mutual trust and confidence.”
Sison and Agcaoili also expressed concern over violations of the unilateral ceasefire with the continued implementation of the military’s Oplan Bayanihan and Oplan Kapayapaan in the countryside, as well as the government’s anti-illegal drugs campaign “Oplan Tokhang” and Double Barrel.
Foreign affairs secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. attended the opening ceremony at the Holiday Inn Rome Eur Parco dei Medici, saying that he was in the country for bilateral talks with his Italian counterpart.
Yasay said he had the opportunity of fulfilling two of the most important items in his bucket list when he came to Rome: meeting Sison, whom he had looked up to as a student at the Central Philippines University in Iloilo; and his personal audience with Pope Francis on Wednesday with presidential adviser on the peace process Jesus Dureza.
Norwegian ambassador to the Philippines Eric Forner and Royal Norwegian government chief mediator, Ambassador Elizabeth Slattum, also graced the opening ceremonies, which was also attended by more than a dozen congressmen as observers.
