President Rodrigo Duterte said he had received reports that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) wants him dead.
Duterte made the remarks in a speech before the Filipino community in Hanoi on Wednesday night.
“Sabi nila pa-plano-plano raw ang CIA na patayin ako. Susmaryosep, ginoo," Duterte said with a straight face while discussing how he would not allow a war with China over disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Duterte on Wednesday night also said that the Philippines' joint military exercises with the US in October will be the last under his administration.
While saying that he would honor the Philippines' treaty obligations with the country's most influential ally and the world's only remaining superpower, Duterte in another speech indicated that he was opening lines with Russia and China
Before briefly mentioning the alleged threat from the US' intelligence agency, Duterte said he would not abandon the favorable ruling made by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Philippines' case against China's excessive claims in the South China Sea.
However, he added that it was not the time to confront China's military with the tribunal's ruling especially if the battleground will be in the archipelago.
"I am not ready to commit the soldiers of this country just to be massacred and besides—besides t— ina, ang battleground, ang Palawan? Naloko na," Duterte said.
"Eh kung dalhin natin doon sa San Francisco okay ako. [laughter]  Oo, ‘yung China, mamili kayo diyan," he added.
“Hindi natin kaya ang China so sabi ko—even with the help of America. So we talk,” Duterte said.
In jest, he then asked the CIA to give him more time to get used to being a President.
“Bigyan mo muna ako ng panahon mag-isip [bilang] Presidente," Duterte said before moving on to another topic.
On Monday, the president claimed that the US disliked him, the same way it disliked Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, and Bashar al-Assad of Syria


Why is the government's campaign against illegal drugs focused on suspects in urban poor communities?
Aside from saying that wealthy drug lords are running their illicit business from outside the country, President Rodrigo Duterte said there's no shabu trade in exclusive villages like Forbes Park in Makati City.
"Wala akong nakitang nag-distribute diyan sa Forbes Park, nagbabantay din ako, kasi ang mga tao diyan hindi shabu ang hinihirit diyan. Ang mga tao diyan hinihirit ay cocaine pati heroin," Duterte said in a news conference, held at the wake of Senior Inspector Mark Garcia.
Garcia died in a buy bust operation in Antipolo over the weekend.
"But cocaine and heroin are not as destructive as shabu because itong cocaine and heroin are manufactured out of the derivatives of a poppy, tanim iyan parang marijuana. So it is not as destructive to the mind as meth, which is just really a combination of a deadly mix of chemicals," Duterte said.
Duterte said the poor mostly use shabu or methamphetamine hydrochloride, which is sold in not so well-off communities.
"Mahihirap ang marami kasi they are an easy target," Duterte said.
On criticisms that his war on drugs was anti-poor, Duterte said campaign exempted no one.
"Just because you are poor, you are excused from apprehension...? Rich or poor, I do not give a shit," Duterte said.
"My order is to destroy," he added.


President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday indicated that he was willing to do what Hitler did to the Jews to the country's criminals.
"Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now, there are three million drug addicts... I'd be happy to slaughter them," Duterte said upon his arrival in Davao City from an official visit to Vietnam.
"At least if Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have… You know my victims, I would like to be, all criminals, to finish  the problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition," he added.
Duterte made the remarks as he once again addressed the criticisms he had been getting from the United States and the European Union for killings attributed to his war on drugs.
"Kayong US, EU, you can call me anything but I was never into or I am never into hypocrisy like you," Duterte said.
"You close your doors. It's winter time. There are migrants escaping from the Middle East. You allow them to rot and the you're worried about the deaths of about one thousand, or two thousand, or three thousand?" he added in apparent reference to the refusal of some countries to allow Syrian refugees into their territories.
According to official police data, more than 3,000 people have been killed in drug-related incidents since Duterte assumed office.
But while he has repeatedly denied having a hand in summary killings, Duterte has not backed off from his tough talk, often repeating that there is no law preventing him from threatening criminals.



President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said he has made a pledge to God to stop cussing in his speeches.
Upon arriving in Davao City after his three-day official visit to Japan, Duterte shared a moment of epiphany during his flight.
"I was looking at the skies as I was coming over here. And I... everybody was asleep snoring. A voice said that you know 'If you don't stop (inaudible), I will bring this plane down now.' And I said, who is this? Of course, it's God. Oh, OK.  So, I promised God not to express slang, cuss words," he said.
"You guys hear me right always because a promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people," he added.
The people present at the event clapped.
To which, Duterte said, "Huwag masyadong palakpak, baka mapalpak pa tuloy."
But when asked whether he would no longer cuss at frequent targets such as the United States, the European Union, or Senator Leila de Lima, Duterte replied: "There is always a time."
"Actually, kung kilala mo ako. magtanong ka sa mga kababata ko. Matagal kaming magkasama. Superman, I can read your mind, ika nga," he said.
"There is always a time. A time to be foul-mouthed. I don't like anybody reading my mind. It's all calibrated, it's always timing. Watch out for one thing, that's what I've learned, miscalculation," he added.

BEIJING — President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday declared that he was breaking the Philippines' military and economic alliance with the United States, the country's longtime ally.
Duterte made the remark before Chinese government officials and business leaders who attended the Philippines-China Trade and Investment Forum.
With the "separation" from the US, Duterte said he would now be relying on the Chinese officials and businessmen.
"I announce my separation from the United States both in the military but economics also. So please you have another problem of economics in my country," Duterte said.
"I have separated from them so I will be dependent on you for a long time but don't worry we will also help," he added.
Duterte said he also planned to visit Russia and firm up ties with Moscow.
"I realign myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin. There are three of us against the world. China, Philippines, Russia," Duterte said.
Duterte over the past months stepped up his anti-US rhetoric after US officials, including US President Barack Obama expressed concern over the alleged extrajudicial killings blamed on his war on drugs.
The President also announced that October's joint military exercises with the US would be the last under his term.
$13.5 billion
Duterte made his comments in China, where he is visiting with at least 200 business people to pave the way for what he calls a new commercial alliance as relations with longtime ally US deteriorate.
His trade secretary, Ramon Lopez, said $13.5 billion in deals would be signed
Duterte's efforts to engage China, months after a tribunal ruling in the Hague over South China Sea disputes in favor of the Philippines, marks a reversal in foreign policy since the 71-year-old former mayor took office on June 30.
China has pulled out all the stops to welcome Duterte, including a marching band complete with batton-twirling band master at his official welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People, which most leaders do not get.
President Xi Jinping, meeting Duterte earlier in the day, called the visit a "milestone" in ties.
Xi told Duterte that China and the Philippines were brothers and they could "appropriately handle disputes", though he did not mention the South China Sea in remarks made in front of reporters.
"I hope we can follow the wishes of the people and use this visit as an opportunity to push China-Philippines relations back on a friendly footing and fully improve things," Xi said.
Following their meeting, during which Duterte said relations with China had entered a new "springtime", Chinese vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin said the South China Sea issue was not the sum total of relations.
"The two sides agreed that they will do what they agreed five years ago, that is to pursue bilateral dialogue and consultation in seeking a proper settlement of the South China Sea issue," Liu said.
China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.
In 2012, China seized the disputed Scarborough Shoal and denied Philippine fishermen access to its fishing grounds.
Liu said the shoal was not mentioned and he did not answer a question about whether Philippine fishermen would be allowed there. He said both countries had agreed on coastguard and fisheries cooperation, but did not give details.
Sea row takes backseat
Duterte's tone toward Beijing is in contrast to the language he has used against the United States, after being infuriated by U.S. criticism of his bloody war on drugs.
On Wednesday, to the cheers of hundreds of Filipinos in Beijing, Duterte said Philippine foreign policy was veering towards China.
"I will not go to America anymore. We will just be insulted there," Duterte said. "So time to say goodbye my friend."
Duterte had said the South China Sea arbitration case would "take the back seat" during talks, and that he would wait for the Chinese to bring up the issue rather than doing so himself.
Xi said issues that could not be immediately be resolved should be set aside, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
China has welcomed the Philippines approaches, even as Duterte has vowed not to surrender any sovereignty to Beijing, which views the South China Sea Hague ruling as null and void.
China has also expressed support for his drug war, which has raised concern in Western capitals about extrajudicial killing.
Duterte's overtures to China have been accompanied by signs of improving business ties with the world's second largest economy.

China's Liu said Beijing will restore Philippine agricultural exports to China and provide financing for Philippine infrastructure.

BEIJING, China - President Rodrigo Duterte said it was "time to say goodbye" to the US during a visit to China on Wednesday, as the combative leader reconfigures his country's diplomatic alliances.
Duterte is in China for a four-day trip that is expected to confirm his tilt away from Washington and towards Beijing's sphere of influence.
During a speech addressing the Filipino community in Beijing, the firebrand president said the Philippines had gained little from its long alliance with the US, its former colonial ruler.
"Your stay in my country was for your own benefit. So time to say goodbye, my friend," he said, as if addressing the US. 
"I will not go to America anymore. I will just be insulted there," he added, before once again referring to US President Barack Obama as a "son of a whore". 
Duterte, who took office in late June, said he was fed up with the Philippines' foreign policy being dictated by a Western agenda. 
"What kept us from China was not our own making. I will charter a new course," he said.
Foreign policy under Duterte has dramatically shifted from that pursued under predecessor Benigno Aquino, who took Beijing to an international tribunal over its extensive territorial claims in the South China Sea and won a resounding victory.
The move infuriated Beijing. But Duterte, who took office in June shortly before the tribunal ruling, has made a point of not flaunting the outcome.
He has also suspended joint US-Philippine patrols in the South China Sea, and has threatened an end to joint military exercises.
- Manila 'a pawn' -
The South China Sea is of intense interest to Washington and it has repeatedly spoken out on the various territorial disputes between China and its neighbours over the strategically vital waters.
Tensions have risen between the US and China over Washington's so-called "pivot" to the Asia-Pacific, a move that Beijing says is intended to contain it.
Duterte will meet top leaders including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang during his stay.
Hours before he spoke, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing that Beijing was pleased to move towards resolving the territorial dispute "through consultation and dialogue". 
"Anyone who truly wishes for peace, stability, development and prosperity in the Asia Pacific" should welcome Duterte's visit, she said.
In an editorial Wednesday, China's nationalist Global Times newspaper said Washington had treated Manila "as a pawn", adding Duterte was now "redesigning Philippine foreign policy based on Philippine interests".
Duterte has said his China trip will focus on promoting economic ties.
The Philippines is hoping, among other things, that Beijing will repeal a ban on imports of its bananas -- an economic sanction intended to punish Manila for its South China Sea stance.
Hua said Wednesday announcements on infrastructure cooperation and economic development projects could be expected during the Philippine leader's visit.
- Drug war -
As Duterte has cosied up to Beijing, he has repeatedly denounced the United States for criticizing the deadly war on crime he instigated upon taking office.
Last month Duterte sparked a diplomatic storm with his tirades after being told the US president would raise the rights concerns at an Asia meeting. 
Beijing, meanwhile, has enthusiastically endorsed Duterte's war on drugs, which has seen more than 3,700 people killed and led the International Criminal Court to warn that those responsible could face charges.
Hua said Wednesday that the two sides were already in close communication about cooperating on drug control and anti-crime issues.  
China has also offered to train some Filipino cadets in "anti-illegal drug and VIP security protection", according to Ramon Purugganan, deputy director of intelligence with the Philippine National Police.

President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday hit out anew at the United States and the European Union in yet another tirade against criticisms of his administration's crime war.
“Instead of helping us, ang unang tumira, itong [US] State Department. So, you can go to hell. Mr. Obama, you can go to hell," he said, referring to American president Barack Obama.
"EU, better choose purgatory. Puno na ang impiyerno. Bakit ako matakot sa inyo?" he added.
Duterte launched his rant after brushing off criticisms over the rising death toll in the crime war. He bristled at suggestions to build rehabilitation centers for drug addicts, noting anew that he came into power in the middle of the year and is working on a budget his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had enacted.
“Nawalan ako ng respeto sa Amerika. Instead of helping us knowing fully well — alam nila kasi they have a similar government as ours — alam nila na iyong bottoms up, bottoms up talaga iyon. Sabi nila, ‘Duterte, why do you have to kill people? Why not go to rehab?’ Easier said than done," he said.
"Where do you get the money? You get money from all department pati Education at kay [Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto] Yasay [Jr.]? Kunin ko kay [Transportation Secretary Arthur] Tugade just to build a rehab? It’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul. Alam nila iyan,” Duterte added.
'At odds'
Sought for comment, the US State Department spokesman said Duterte's remarks seem at odds with the warm relationship between the Philippine and U.S. people and the record of cooperation between the governments.
"We've already spoken to this sort of rhetoric," John Kirby said when asked about Duterte's comments on Tuesday.
"Frankly, it seems at odds with the warm relationship that exists between the Filipino and American people and the record of important cooperation between our two governments, cooperation that has continued under the Duterte government."
Duterte had made numerous international headlines over the past few weeks over his near-daily rants against groups who have spoken out about the rising death toll in his war on drugs.
The president brought up the issue again in his speech at the Sulong Pilipinas Local Governance Series while justifying why he has decided to end joint military exercises with the United States.
"Maniwala ka diyan sa Amerikano. They will not fight to die for us. Tanungin mo diyan ang military. Iyang war games war games, sila lang ang natututo diyan using our soldiers," Duterte said.
Filipino and American troops began their latest joint exercise on Tuesday. Duterte had said that the scheduled exercises would be the last under his term.
"'Wag mo ako paluhurin sa Amerika. Never," he said.

President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday said he agreed with the military assessment that there was no need to declare martial law, even as he raised the threat of Islamist terror groups on the Philippines.
Days after saying no one could stop him if he wanted to do so, Duterte also stressed that no one could keep him from imposing military rule if need be, adding that he would so quietly.
"I will not declare martial law. Kung magde-declare man ako, hindi ako mag-ingay. At magtanong anong basis, p— ina ka, wala kang pakialam. Basta tumahimik kayong lahat," Duterte said to applause in Cabanatuan City.
Duterte questioned the wisdom of having to take up the validity of a martial law declaration with Congress or the Supreme Court.
"Ganoon iyan eh. Sino ba namang gagong presidente, 'Mag-declare ako ng martial law. O Supreme Court, pwede ba ito? Congress?' Basta ako, it is not found in the Constitution," Duterte said.
"It is not written there but if I feel as President that I have to preserve my country, I will declare martial law, pero kung sabihin lang ninyo na peace and order ganoon," he added.
An Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman earlier this week said that it saw no need to recommend the President's declaration of martial law.
Duterte agreed but adverted to developments regarding ISIS.
"Ngayon, tama ang military. There is no compelling reason [to declare Martial Law]. But I will just fill you in the days to come. It's ISIS is coming in very fast. Itong Mindanao is a pure case of rising nationalism," Duterte said.
"Ngayon, iba na ang istorya because the ISIS contaminated Mindanao," he added.
Duterte then turned his attention to media reporting on his pronouncements.
"Ang media kasi hindi nakikinig eh. Ang naririnig lang nila martial law. Hindi ako stupid. Mas bright tayo sa kanila. Alam mo sa totoo lang, kung mas bright sila sa akin, sila ngayon ang gumagamit nito," Duterte said.
"Eh ako bright. And besides it's a God-given not even gift but it's a God-given task and I won't do it for a flimsy reason," he added.

President Rodrigo Duterte late Wednesday spoke out anew against the United States, citing the push for same-sex marriage that seemed to indicate that the country has lost its principles.
Duterte went on a rant against the US after a question from reporter Jonathan Miller, the Asia correspondent of Britain's Channel 4 news, about the president's pronouncement about a "new order" with Russia and China.
Duterte spoke out about the US depriving its allies of arms, alluding anew to reports that the US State Department had canceled a purchase of the Philippine National Police of rifles from an American supplier.
He said there is a lot of pressure on the State Department "because of your multi-racial population."
"They have groups there. The LGBT, they go to Liberia, they go to State Department guys, and offer aid and assistance. But, they said, come out with the law that would allow same-sex marriages," Duterte said.
"What's happening? Where are the principles that the builders of America... they have lost along the way?"
Last year, the US Supreme Court handed down a landmark ruling allowing same-sex marriage for gay and lesbian couples nationwide.
Aid conditionality
An advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights meanwhile said Duterte's comments was about aid conditionality.
In a post on her Facebook account, prominent Duterte supporter Sass Rogando Sasot said the President's comments were an example of how special interest groups try to influence the moves of the US State Department.
"Ano ba ang sinasabi ni Duterte? Ipinapaliwanag ni Duterte na ang US State Department ay influenced ng mga domestic pressure groups. Ang US State Department po ang parang DFA ng Pilipinas; at ang mga LGBT groups ay isang uri ng domestic pressure groups," she wrote.
"Ang sinabi ni Duterte ay nasa konteksto ng tinatawag na 'aid conditionality.' Ang ibig pong sabihin ng aid conditionality ay ang pagpataw ng certain conditions sa isang bansa para makatanggap sila ng tulong sa bansang nagbibigay ng aid. Ginamit po ni Duterte ang 'same sex marriage' bilang halimbawa ng 'condition' ng isang aid."
Sasot noted that aid conditionality is opposed by LGBT activists in Africa and the Middle East, citing a 2012 statement by groups denouncing the practice.
"Noong May 2012, tinakot ng United Kingdom ang mga African countries na gustong i-criminalise ang homosexuality. Sabi ng Prime Minister nila noon na si David Cameron, babawasan ng UK ang aid sa mga bansang iyon kung hindi nila i-decriminalise ang homosexuality," she wrote, quoting the statement saying that "Western governments should seek more respectful ways of working with the African continent."
Duterte has gone on regular tirades against the US over criticism of the increasing death toll of his administration's drug war. In the news conference, Duterte once again defended the government, saying not all deaths should be attributed to authorities.
