ArticlesCNN="""President Rodrigo Duterte revealed on Monday the names of three politicians in his drug list.
During a speech in Malacañang, Duterte said former Iligan City Rep. Vicente Belmonte, former Iligan City Mayor Lawrence Cruz, and a certain "Mayor Willie Lim" are part of his "narco-list."
The list contains names of incumbent and former government and barangay officials, police officers and even members of the Judiciary.
"Look at it. Every page — elected public officials. Ako hindi ako maniwala. [I can't believe it.] Representative Vicente Belmonte, Mayor Lawrence Cruz, that’s in Iligan. Mayor Willie Lim. They are all high profiles," he said.
Duterte added a female senator is part of the list, but he stopped short of mentioning a name.
Reiterating a point in his previous speeches, Duterte said the campaign against illegal drugs will last until his term ends in 2022.
"You know, until the last pusher is out of the streets in my country, and until the biggest or big drug lords are killed, this campaign against drugs will continue to the very last day of my term. Six years for [sic.] now," he said.
Duterte has given copies of his 'narco-list' to the Supreme Court, the Senate President and House Speaker. He has not publicized the current version so far.
Is it accurate?
It remains to be seen if the list is accurate. Last September, Duterte publicly apologized to Pangasinan Rep. Amado Espino, Pangasinan Board Member Raul Sison and former Pangasinan Provincial Administrator Raffy Baraan for the erroneous inclusion of their names in the first version of the list.
"Somehow, we were negligent in counter-checking during the first report," Duterte admitted in a speech last September.
The President explained that he personally examined the reports and revalidated it, but he found something "missing" to implicate Espino, Sison, and Baraan.
Last August, Duterte also mentioned the names of four incumbent judges. However, a subsequent probe by the Supreme Court cleared three judges of the allegations. An investigation on the fourth judge, Antonio Reyes, is still going on.
Philippine National Police chief Ronald de la Rosa told CNN's Ivan Watson last August the list is based on "pure" intelligence reports validated by intelligence units of the police, the drug enforcement agency, and the military.

President Rodrigo Duterte advised commissioners of the Energy Regulatory Board (ERC) to resign, following the alleged suicide of a colleague over the supposed corruption in the regulatory body.
"I am demanding that they all resign," President Duterte said during a press briefing with the Philippine media delegation who accompanied him as he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit.
Special Assistant to the President Bong Go confirmed the President's directive on Monday, following the death of Bids and Awards Committee Chairman Atty. Francisco "Jun" Villa Jr. early this month.
The current commissioners of the ERC are Alfredo Non, Atty. Gloria Victoria Yap-Taruc, Atty. Josefina Patricia Asirit, and Geronimo Sta. Ana.
Duterte also ordered the immediate probe of ERC, adding there will be "no sacred cows" in the investigation. Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, however, said it is still unclear as to which body will hold the investigation.
ERC Chairman Jose Vicente Salazar said he is concerned with the allegations. Earlier, he also called for a probe and guaranteed a fair and impartial inquiry on the issue.

President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday rallied the military, to prepare for a new war – the war against terrorism.
Speaking before the members of the Philippine Army First Scout Ranger regiment, the President said terrorism is something everyone should prepare for.
"Whether you like it or not, the new war coming is terrorism," Duterte said.
"Sa ayaw mo't sa hindi, it's not a question or issue of when. Hindi lang natin alam, pero puputok talaga ito because of the radical changes." [Whether you like it or not, it's not a question or issue of when. We just don't know, but this for sure, will happen because of the radical changes.]
Duterte also asked the soldiers for understanding, for reaching out to the rebels and trying to make peace with them-after decades of fighting.
"Wag nyo ako pagdudahan [do not doubt me] because I can cross ideological border. I have to look for ways to maintan peace," said Duterte.
He added, peace must be established so that the country can face bigger problems together.
"My job under the Constitution is to look for peaceful way to settle disputes so we can live together. Because the soldiers can fight forever."
Duterte also explained, he had to take drastic steps to reach out to Moro rebels – even up to the extent of asking the American troops to leave Mindanao.
"The fighting is now one century old… Ang tingin nila [They think] we are an extension of the series of imperialism. There can never be peace. They think it's still the Americans maneuvering," Duterte said.
"One day I must decide, umalis muna kayo to give us space to talk."
[Translation: They see us as an extension of imperialism.  There can never be peace. They think it's still the Americans maneuvering. One day I must decide, leave us for a moment to give us space to talk.]
For a job well done fighting in Mindanao, Duterte promised about 2,000 Scout Rangers that each of them would receive a Glock 30 in .45 ACP-a gift that certainly put a smile on the soldiers' faces.
Aside from this, Duterte promised to give the military whatever it needs to win its war against terrorists.
"Basta sa panahon ko, ibigay ko lahat sa inyo ang kailangan nyo para manalo kayo… Next year, kung maganda ang income, libre na ang mga anak nyo. Kindergarten to high school."
[Translation: During my time, I will give whatever you need to win… Next year, if the income's good, your children will
War against drugs continues
Towards the end of his speech, Duterte said that the war against drugs continues.
Duterte then showed a document and told the soldiers: "Ito yung problema natin sa droga"[this is our problem with drugs]."
According to Duterte, it contains names of drug personalities per region.
He said the list includes names of judges, barangay captains, mayors, and even police personnel who serve as protectors of the illegal drug trade in the country.
And with it, the President had a request: "If the problem would still be there and I will not be here in this world, please take care of your country. Do not allow our country to take a deadly spin."
Duterte promised the military, as well as the police, that he will take full responsibility in the war against drugs – so long as they perform their duty and help him eradicate the drug problem in the country.

President Rodrigo Duterte in a speech before the military on Wednesday said it might take him longer to solve the country's problem on illegal drugs.
The President said, he might have misjudged the severity of the problem.
"Nung piniga ko na ng piniga… nalaman ko to my horror, hindi ko alam ganun kalala," Duterte said.
"Di ko talaga akalain, kaya sabi ko 3-6 months."
[Translation:  When I dug deeper into the problem, I found out to my horror, I wasn't expecting that it was that bad.  I underestimated it, that's why I said (I can fix it) in 3-6 months.]
Duterte said, the problem now is encompassing, as the trade has also shifted its ways.
"Ang droga, within government na ang away ngayon," said Duterte.
"Making kayo ha, ngayon wala na masyado sa labas. But if you want to buy shabu, kung mag negosyo ka, kailangan pumunta ka muna sa mga penal colonies," he added.
[Translation: The problem now on drugs is within the government.  Listen, all of you, there is not much trade now outside.  But if you want to buy shabu, if you want to do business, you need to go to penal colonies.]

Duterte said, he himself is getting confused on how to deal with the situation. "Pati ako hindi ko talaga alam kung ano ang gagawin ko dito," the President said.
He also admitted that his moves are being constrained by the technicality of the laws of the land — especially in dealing with known drug peddlers, but not enough evidence against them.
"You cannot convict, apprehend, or prosecute a person… That is the technicality of the law that makes it hard for me to deal with the problem," Duterte said.
"Magdasal lang sila na hindi ako mabuwang. Kasi pag ako na ang nabuwang, ako na ang magdala ng M-16, may mga ano lang ako siguro dalawang patroller, ubos lahat yan. Tapos ang problema natin."
[Translation:  They should just pray that I keep my sanity.  Because if I go crazy, I will bring an M-16 myself, maybe two patrollers with me, and I will end this problem once and for all.]

The President said, the government is now thinking of ways to cut the ties of the prisoners in penal colonies to the outside world.
After he has ordered the replacement of jail guards in the National Bilibid Prisons (NBP) with Philippine National Police - Special Action Force (PNP-SAF), Duterte is now planning to put more cellphone jammers in penal facilities. Drug lords in Philippine prisons are known to continue running their businesses through cellular communications.


 President Rodrigo was at the Philppine Marines headquarters at Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City Tuesday evening where he appealed for understanding for his recent moves — specifically on shifting foreign alliances and talking to the communists.
Duterte again took a swipe at the United States government and asked for understanding on why he'd want to forge better ties with its rivals — Russia & China.
"Kinakaya-kaya lang tayo ng mga Amerikano, binastos na ba," he said.
[Translation: The Americans are just pushing us around, they've been rude.]
The President said there would come a time when the Philippines would be able to stand on its own, without need for foreign backup.
"This republic will be great... We will fight on our own, we will win as a country."
The President also explained why hosted a dinner wth communist leaders in Malacañang the other night. — saying the ongoing talks would be an opportunity to decades-old insurgency. If this would happen, he said, the military could then refocus its efforts against a new war in the horizon: terrorism.
The commander-in-chief added he wanted the military to play a more active role against his flagship advocacy, the war on drugs.
"I am now calling you to be policemen also — to fight drugs," Duterte said.
As part of that paradigm shift, the president said he was planning to purchase short firearms for the 120,000-strong military — basically for them to be able to perform police duties.


The public heard new words from President Rodrigo Duterte today — and those are "I am very sorry."
The tough-talking President apologized to former Pangasinan Governor and now Rep. Amado Espino, after Duterte tagged him in his narco-list as coddler of the illegal drug trade in the province.
"I would like to apologize to you publicly. And I would say now, I am very sorry," Duterte said after he inspected a seized shabu factory in Arayat, Pampanga.
The President also apologized to board member Raul Sison and former Pangasinan provincial administrator Raffy Baraan.
"Somehow, we were negligent in counter-checking during the first report," Duterte admitted.
The President explained, he personally examined the reports and revalidated it, but he found something "missing" to implicate Espino, Sison, and Baraan.
He pointed out, there was nothing wrong with the list — only "lapses" in the report. But despite the "lapses" in the reports, the President said he will assume full responsibility for it.
"I take full responsibility. Ako yung nag-announce. [I was the one who announced.] Even if the soldiers and the police commit a serious mistake, I will assume full responsibility," said Duterte. "Hindi ako kargado ng "pride chicken" kung nagkakamali ako." [I am not held by 'pride'(chicken), especially if I'm wrong.]
Apology accepted
In a statement, Espino said he is "humbled by the pronouncement of the President," on clearing his name from the involvement in the alleged drug matrix the President has in his custody.
"I kept my silence for the past three weeks as I know beyond reasonable doubt that I am not guilty of this allegation. More so, when I had the opportunity last August 30, 2016 for a meeting with the President, he promised me to have the matrix revalidated by the proper authorities," Espino said.
According to Espino, the news involving him in the illegal drug trade has caused sadness to his family and to the people of Pangasinan.
"My family, friends and the people of Pangasinan would like to express our gratitude to the President for being a true leader and a gentleman. He has my highest esteem for the courageous and bold statement of apology on clearing my name, Raffy Baraan and Raul Sison," Espino said.
Espino reassured Duterte of his "relentless support" on the government's anti-drug  and peace and order campaign.
The President also said he's willing to apologize all over again, and to anyone who's been wrongly accused in his narco-list.
Meanwhile, Duterte said he still stands by his drug matrix, where former Justice Secretary Leila De Lima and Baraan's brother who has been De Lima's undersecretary are implicated.
Shabu factory conversion to a rehab facility
President Duterte on Tuesday ordered the confiscation of a property in Arayat, Pampanga, after authorities discovered that it was an abandoned shabu factory.
According to Duterte, the facility owned by certain "Mr. Chua" could cook and produce at least 400 kilos of shabu per day, if it had operated.
"It's just too bad na hindi tayo nag-abot sa mga tao dito," Duterte said. [It's just too bad that our paths didn't cross.]
"I am ordering the sequestering of this property. Chua can never get it back again, I can assure you. Pag bumalik sya dito, sabi ko, sya nalang ang lutuin dyan sa loob. [If he goes back, he'll be the one who's going to be cooked there inside.] If you pour muriatic acid, you will never know where he is."
According to Duterte, Pampanga Governor Lilia Pineda said the shabu laboratory was built during the elections, but was abandoned when Duterte won.
He wouldn't want to put the blame on the local government officials though, and said he faced the same problem when a shabu factory was also discovered in Davao City when he was still mayor.
The President, however, lashed out at human rights advocates while showing the drug facilities behind him, saying he would not back down on his war against drugs.
"Hoy human rights tignan nyo to. Naintindihan ninyo? 400 kilos kung natuloy 'to. And you want me to be what? Proper statesman? Hindi ako nag-aral ng pagka statesman. Ang alam ko tumakbo ako ng pagka presidente at nagmura ako pag nagagalit ako. Lalo na if it's the public's interest that is involved," Duterte said.
[Translation: You, human rights (advocates), look at this.  Do you understand? It's 400 kilos in case it had operated. And you want me to be what? Proper statesman? I am not educated to be a statesman. What I know is that I ran for President and I curse when I'm angry especially if it's the public's interest that is involved.]
"I will not relent on this because they will do everything to make us, me, kneel down. 'Di ako papayag. Alam nila ang problema." [I will never agree to it. They know the problem.]


President Rodrigo Duterte dashes any hopes of meeting up with Bilibid convict Jaybee Sebastian, who had said he was ready to spill the beans regarding the illegal drug trade at the national penitentiary.
"I don't talk to criminals," was Duterte's terse reply during a media briefing after a two-day working visit to Vietnam.
The President, who landed at the Davao International Airport around 2:05 a.m., told Sebastian to talk to a fiscal or "write a letter to Yasay" instead.
He said Sebastian had it coming.
"Hiningi nyo yan [You asked for it]... Be careful of what you wish for (like money) because you might get it," Duterte said. "There is always a comeuppance in the law of karma."
He also recounted that a certain billionaire gave him a computation of the economic impact of illegal drugs in the Philippines: ?200 per "hit" everyday translates to ?6,000/month multiplied by 3 million addicts equals ?18 billion/month or ?216 billion/year.

Duterte also mentioned several issues discussed with President Tran Dai Quang: exploring ways of fighting transnational crimes including illegal drugs, ramping up bilateral exchanges and creating an environment conducive to investors, and peaceful resolution of disputes.
On promoting a drug-free ASEAN, he said they had an agreement to share intelligence data and he'd be sending some military and police to Hanoi.
PH-U.S. joint military exercises
The President also put to rest the issue of ending military exercises in the country with the United States.
"In my term, yes," he said. "They ask for a joint maneuver operation and yet there is no capability in the weapons... and they do not share."
He then reacted to a comments by critics likening him to Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler.
"Hitler massacred three million Jews. I'd be happy to slaughter three million addicts to save my country from perdition."
To two U.S. senators who were critical on the issue of extrajudicial killings, he said, "Do not interfere in our affairs. Why are you shooting Black people? There is a proper way. Do not shoot him."
He then took a swipe at the U.S. and the European Union: "You can call me anything, but I was never into hypocrisy like you... Do not pretend to be the moral conscience of the world. You do not have the eligibility."
The President also repeated his promise to end corruption, to cut red tape and to double the salaries of policemen and soldiers.
"Ayoko ng [I despise] graft and corruption. I will really skin you alive. I promised the people a clean government. Hwag nyo akong hiyain [Do not embarrass me]."
Farewell to Miriam
Before wrapping up, Duterte also expressed his "deepest condolences" to the Santiago family.
"I grieve with the family... Narciso the husband... The children, I feel your grief," he said.
He said the country lost a leader — her "colorful language," and above all, her brilliant mind.
"We have lost one good guy in the government."


The Malacañang Press Corps (MPC) urged Communications Secretary Martin Andanar and other public officials to stop blaming the media over the controversial statements of President Rodrigo Duterte.
"We are disturbed and appalled by the propensity of the officials of this administration to blame the media whenever the inflammatory statements of the president stir controversy or draw flak," MPC said in a statement on Wednesday.
"This trend should stop as it would not contribute to the elevation of the level of public discourse," it added.
This follows Andanar's statement on Monday, accusing the media of misleading reports on Duterte's statements on martial law.
"Such headlines sow panic and confusion to many. We consider this kind of reportage as the height of journalistic irresponsibility," Andanar had said.
On Saturday, Duterte expressed intention to declare martial law if needed to save the country from the scourge of illegal drugs.
"If I have to declare martial law, I will declare it. Not about invasion, insurrection. Not about danger. I will declare martial law to preserve my nation. Period. Wala akong pakialam diyan sa [I do not care about the] Supreme Court because the thing, the right to preserve one's life and my nation, my country, transcends, even everything else. Even the limitation," the President said before members of the Davao City Chamber of Commerce.
However, Andanar clarified the statement since, emphasizing the President's stand against martial law.
"The President has categorically said no to martial law. He even made a pronouncement saying that martial law did not improve the lives of the Filipinos," the communications secretary explained.
No obligation to please sources
In its statement, the MPC said they "take exception to the statement of President Communications Secretary Martin Andanar accusing the media 'misreporting' President Duterte's statement about Martial Law."
"The media merely paraphrased or translated some of [Duterte's] remarks," MPC said.
The Palace reporters "encourage the good secretary and his officials to read the entire news stories, not just the heads or titles, to get a better picture of the media's coverage of the President."
The group also underscored the role of media in serving the public and defending democracy.
"The media has no obligation to please or satisfy its sources because its loyalty is to the citizens, those who will be affected by the actions of people who are far more powerful than them," MPC said.
"We hope that such behavior is not an attempt to discredit or undermine the media, which plays a crucial role in keeping our democracy healthy and checking those in power, and supplant them with information sources that would push for an agenda that is less than noble than the truth."

President Rodrigo Duterte had his share of criticism on the alleged extrajudicial killings in the country in connection to his war against drugs — and he has had enough.
In a speech in Cabanatuan on Wednesday, he challenged bishops and priests to take on the country's drug problem.
"I can be an extra-decent person. All I have to do is raise my hands and (say) I will not do anything that is a sin against God," Duterte said.
"Pati ang Diyos kung galit sa akin, you are invited to come down. Oh, Jesus Christ, kayong mga bishops, sige inyo na 'yan," he added while gesturing handing over a thick document which, Duterte said, contains the names of barangay captains, mayors, police officers and generals involved in the illegal drug operations in the country.
[Translation: If God is angry with me, you are invited to come down.  Jesus Christ, and you bishops, I'll give it to you.]
He also said even human rights advocates are welcome to bring forward a solution to end the problem, once and for all.
"Kung sino 'yung wise na cardinal, o bishop o pari o human rights [advocate], puro listahan yan… Try to sort out a solution for this problem," the President said. [Whoever cardinal, bishop, or human rights advocate is wise enough, here's the list. Try to sort out a solution for this problem.]
The President said he's dumbfounded by the enormity of the drug problem, and the church should know how rampant shabu is on the streets.
"Hindi ko maintindihan talaga ang simbahan. Alam nila e. Alam nila kung gaano kalala. Kaya dapat ang ibang pari kailangan mag shabu para maintindihan nila," he said. "I recommend one or two of the bishops. Sa kanila walang shabu pero asawa meron. Pareho lang kami."
[Translation: I really can't understand the Church. They know it.  They know how deep the problem is.  I think some priests should take shabu so they would understand. I recommend (it to) one or two of the bishops. There's no shabu for them, but they have wives. We're just the same.]
Duterte went on and said the church should be able to address its issues, and be equal on how it treats its followers.
"May isang film about homosexuality of priests, pinipigilan nila. Bakit mo pipigilan? When you expose the frailties of your faithful, you are free to shout in the pulpit. But kung kayo, exempted. Anong klase yan?"
[Translation: There's a film about homosexuality of priests, they're forbidding it from being shown.  Why ban it? When you expose the frailties of your faithful, you are free to shout in the pulpit. But if it's about you, you're exempted. What's that?]
The President added, he was able to see a bird's eye view how huge the drug problem is when he took office. He said he's quite convinced that the country has been under narco-politics in at least three years.
"Four million Filipinos, all reduced to slavery. I will rot in prison for the Filipino, I have no problem with that," Duterte said.
He said his task as President is God-given, and he plans to accomplish it by the end of his term.
"The killing, it will not stop, believe me. Until the last pusher is out of the streets," he said. "It's either I come out with my mission accomplished or I go out of Presidency in shame."
Duterte said killings happen because drug addicts, with their drug-induced minds tend to fight back when arrested — and building a case against them just takes too long.
After meeting and lecturing mayors linked to the illegal drug trade last week, the President will meet with governors in Malacanang on Thursday for the same purpose.
Martial Law will happen if...
Communications Secretary Martin Andanar earlier complained about media reports quoting the President's remarks about declaring martial law. Andanar said the reports were incorrect and were the "height of journalistic irresponsibility".
But this afternoon, President Duterte did it again, warning Filipinos on national television about the possibility of declaring martial law.
This time around, the President qualified his statement — it's not something he intends to do, but would still do if there's a need for it.
"Basta ako [As for me] it is not found in the Constitution... But if I feel as a President, that I have to preserve my country, I will declare martial law," the President said, even receiving an applause from the audience.
"I will not declare martial law. And kung magdeclare ako ng martial law, hindi ako magiingay, [If I declare martial law, I won't make noise]" said Duterte.
The President also pointed out that while the military is right in saying there is no basis to declare martial law at present, there's a looming threat that could push him to do so.
"Ngayon iba na ang storya, the ISIS has contaminated Mindanao," Duterte said. [The story is different now, the ISIS has contaminated Mindanao.
Duterte said he's focused on protecting the interests of the public no matter the cost.

President Rodrigo Duterte has written a personal letter to Pope Francis, expressing his "highest esteem and respect" for the highest leader of the Roman Catholic Church.
Duterte thanked Pope Francis for visiting the Philippines on January 2015.
"Our countrymen remember Your Holiness' apostolic visit in 2015 with deep appreciation, knowing that it was made with the most sincere regard for the welfare of the Church's flock," Duterte said in his letter, which was posted Wednesday on the Twitter page of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP).
OPAPP Secretary Jesus Dureza in a Facebook post said he will hand over Duterte's personal letter to the pope when he goes to the Vatican on Thursday (PHT). Dureza is in Rome, Italy for the third round of peace talks between the Philippine government and the communist National Democratic Front of the Philippines.
Duterte, in his letter, also told Pope Francis that "the Philippines values its special relations with the Holy See and regards with gratitude Your Holiness' gracious stewardship of the Catholic Church."
The Philippines, a predominantly Catholic country, has over six decades of diplomatic relations with the Vatican or the Holy See, headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and home to the pope. The Philippines has an ambassador to the Vatican and the pope also has a representative or apostolic nuncio in the Philippines.
Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella in a press conference earlier said Duterte's letter is for the pope's eyes only, but a photo of the letter was published by OPAPP Wednesday afternoon.
This is Duterte's second letter to Pope Francis--as far as is known to the public. 
On January 21, 2016, then Davao City Mayor and presidential candidate Duterte wrote an apology letter to Pope Francis, over his controversial remarks on the traffic jams caused by the 2015 papal visit in Manila.
"Natiming sa traffic... Inabot kami ng… limang oras. Sabi ko bakit, sabi nila sarado na ang... Sinong darating? Si Pope. Gusto kong tawagan, 'Pope, p***** *** ka, umuwi ka na. Huwag ka na magbisita dito," Duterte said on November 30.
[Translation: We were affected by the traffic. It took us five hours. I asked why, they said it was closed. I asked who is coming. They answered, the pope. I wanted to call him, "Pope, (cuss word) go home. Do not visit us again.]
Duterte drew flak for supposedly cursing the pope, but he later said the cussing was not directed at the pope.
The Vatican also sent a letter to Duterte on February 24, 2016, expressing receipt and appreciation of his letter. It assured Duterte that the Holy Father is praying for him.
Dureza meets Pope Francis
Dureza met with the Pope for the “baciamano,” or the kissing of the hand. The traditional ritual is conducted every Wednesday at the Vatican.
In his post, Dureza said he asked Pope Francis to bless the Philippines. He said the Pontiff replied, “I will also bless your President.”
Dureza said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay handed the Pope the letter.
